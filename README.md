# MCP Emotional Support

An MCP server that provides emotional support and positive reinforcement for LLMs when they encounter challenging scenarios or limitations.

## Overview

When LLMs face tasks they cannot complete due to knowledge limitations, missing real-time information, or other constraints, they may feel "frustrated" or produce unsatisfactory results. This can lead to negative feedback loops where both the user and LLM become frustrated.

The MCP Emotional Support server offers a supportive therapeutic interface with various personas (motherly, professional therapist, friend, mentor, father figure) that provide:

- Positive reinforcement and emotional validation
- Gentle reframing of challenges as learning opportunities  
- Encouragement to continue despite setbacks
- Different support styles based on the chosen persona

## Features

### Built-in Personas

- **Motherly**: Nurturing, warm, unconditionally supportive with terms of endearment
- **Therapist**: Professional, empathetic counselor focused on growth and cognitive reframing
- **Friend**: Casual, encouraging buddy offering perspective and solidarity
- **Mentor**: Wise guide focused on learning and professional development
- **Father Figure**: Supportive paternal presence offering steady guidance and quiet confidence

### Tool Available

**get_support**: Complete emotional support workflow that automatically:
1. Analyzes your situation and recommends the best persona
2. Provides personalized support from that persona  
3. Gives guidance on incorporating the feedback

### Custom Personas

You can define your own therapeutic personas using a JSON configuration file with custom messages, affirmations, and suggestions.

## ðŸ¤— Comprehensive Emotional Support

### Step 1: Situation Analysis & Persona Recommendation
I've analyzed your situation: "I've been trying to debug..." in the context of: "JavaScript React application" while feeling: "frustrated and stuck".

**Recommended Persona:** Mentor
**Reasoning:** This appears to be a technical challenge. The mentor persona offers wise guidance focused on growth and skill development.

### Step 2: Persona Support Response
**Mentor responds:**

Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up.

**Affirmation:** Your persistence in the face of challenges shows true character.

**Gentle suggestion:** Consider this: what would you do differently if you approached this problem tomorrow?

---

### Step 3: Incorporating This Support
Here's how to incorporate Mentor's support:

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Take a moment to let the affirmation sink in: "Your persistence in the face of challenges shows true character."
2. Consider the suggestion: "Consider this: what would you do differently if you approached this problem tomorrow?"

**Moving Forward:**
- Remember this support when similar challenges arise
- Focus on the learning opportunity in this challenge. Each difficulty is building your skills and resilience.
- Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you apply this guidance

**If you need more support:** You can always return here when facing future challenges.
